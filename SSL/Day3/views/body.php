		<p>Chuck ipsum.
 Chuck Norris sleeps with a night light. Not because Chuck Norris is afraid of the dark, but the dark is afraid of Chuck Norris.
 Chuck Norris invented water.
 Although it is not common knowledge, there are actually three sides to the Force: the light side, the dark side, and Chuck Norris.</p>
 <p>If Superman and The Flash were to race to the edge of space you know who would win? Chuck Norris. 
 Chuck Norris never cries, because of this when he's sad he roundhouse kicks himself and it makes him feel better since he knows he is the only one who can survive the roundhouse.</p>
 <p class="last">When asked what type of vehicle he drives, Chuck Norris responded slyly with "Don't you mean what kind of vehicle drives me?"
 Before science was invented it was once believed that autumn occurred when Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked every tree in existence.</p>
